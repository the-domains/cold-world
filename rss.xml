            <title><![CDATA[L Fest 2016]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>L Fest 2016</h1><p>We all tried and we all failed. The hype was real when word came out that they were re-releasing the Pirate Black Yeezy Boost 350's the weekend after ASG. February itself is already an expensive month for sneakers with the All-Star packs from the major brands and other collaborations from companies such as Asics that just pop up randomly. I struck out on every Yeezy boost to date but I wanted to try again so I did my usual rounds at FootLocker, FootAction, Champs, Shoe Palace, Feature LV, and CRSVR to enter their in-store raffles. Here in Vegas we get tons of pairs shipped in to the various sneaker places we got so chances to cop in person are higher than other places. I entered raffles for every store twice; once each day the raffle was up that Monday and Tuesday. Since release was on Saturday I waited for the calls on Thursday and Friday and got nothing at all. Straight crickets. The L's started rolling in at this point. </p></article>]]></description>
