description: "We all tried and we all failed. The hype was real when word came out that they were re-releasing the Pirate Black Yeezy Boost 350's the weekend after ASG. February itself is already an expensive month for sneakers with the All-Star packs from the major brands and other collaborations from companies such as Asics that just pop up randomly. I struck out every Yeezy boost to date but I wanted to try again so I did my usual rounds at FootLocker, FootAction, Champs, Shoe Palace, Feature LV, and CRSVR. Here in Vegas we get tons of pairs shipped in to the various sneaker places we got so chances to cop in person are higher than other places. I entered raffles for every store twice; once each day the raffle was up. Since release was on Saturday I waited for the calls on Thursday and Friday and got nothing at all. The L's started rolling in at this point. "
