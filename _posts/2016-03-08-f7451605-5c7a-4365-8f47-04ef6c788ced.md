We all tried and we all failed. The hype was real when word came out that they were re-releasing the Pirate Black Yeezy Boost 350's the weekend after ASG. February itself is already an expensive month for sneakers with the All-Star packs from the major brands and other collaborations from companies such as Asics that just pop up randomly. I struck out on every Yeezy boost to date but I wanted to try again so I did my usual rounds at FootLocker, FootAction, Champs, Shoe Palace, Feature LV, and CRSVR to enter their in-store raffles. Here in Vegas we get tons of pairs shipped in to the various sneaker places we got so chances to cop in person are higher than other places. I entered raffles for every store twice; once each day the raffle was up that Monday and Tuesday. Since release was on Saturday I waited for the calls on Thursday and Friday and got nothing at all. Straight crickets. The L's started rolling in at this point. 

The day of release I woke up at 7AM and got my computers set up. 10 browsers across 3 laptops including 2 browsers on my girlfriend and I's cell phones. Adidas site went live at 8AM and I was in queue. I thought I struck gold when 15 minutes in I got through on a site and was able to add to cart in my size 8.5\. I had issues getting to the check out screen but once I was able to get to that I had also got in on 2 other browsers on the other laptops. Great luck indeed as I was also able to add to cart but I didn't want to get too far ahead of myself. Good thing I didn't because I wasn't able to get to the checkout screen on any of the browsers and before I knew it Adidas sent out the dreaded"SOLD OUT" tweet. Another L in the books so I went and got donuts. 

Then Monday rolled around, I worked my 7-3 shift at work and when I got off I had a voicemail from a number I didn't recognize. I assumed it was from a company where I had put an app in but it turned out to be a dude from Foot Action saying I had won the raffle. I was caught off guard to say the least. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6e1b2a4c-5024-4d6a-9901-933c7fdc0007.jpg)
