### NIKE OUTLET STEALS

I keep hearing about people finding "steals" at the Nike outlets everywhere but I've yet to find one myself. I've come to believe that it's all lies and people were just telling stories to get views or clicks. Recently I popped into my local Nike outlet before work looking for a steal. Since I work at the outlet it's not hard for me to pop in so I try to stop by a couple times a week. I'd been going for a few months now with no luck at all. I thought it was part bad timing, part bullshit, part bad luck. So I popped in anyways and low and behold I finally found a steal in my size. Yes, it's just a Flyknit Air Max nothing crazy rare with a lot of hype but being that it retails for $225 and I was lucky enough to be able to cop for $80 I was pretty hype. The cashier tried to charge me $180 for what it rung up but they honored the wrong sticker price that an associate had put on the box. Good day for me.
