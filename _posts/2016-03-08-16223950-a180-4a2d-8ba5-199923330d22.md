I've seen a lot of sneaker restorations online, specifically YouTube, from guys like Sneaker Head In The Bay and Retro Snickers so I thought I'd try it myself. I bought these Air Raids from the outlet mall here in Las Vegas when I was 14 years old for a whopping $29\. The production date on the inside tag reads 3-11-04\. Today is 3-7-16 so we're coming up almost 12 years to the day since when these were produced. I wore these all throughout high school and played on them indoor and outdoor no matter the situation.
